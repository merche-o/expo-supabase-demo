# Expo-io/ReactNative  : Event app

Here a small fullstack demo project using expo.io and Supabase.
You can login/Signup/Logout, create/join an event and enter the realtime chat of each event.

### Installation

After clonning the repository

you need to install `expo` in order to launch the project by using this command `npm install --global expo-cli`

I used expo, because i was planning to also release the iOS and Android version of the test, but i run out of time :(.

Once you installed expo you just need to  run `npm install` then `expo start`

It will launch `expo` portal, you will just need to click on `run in web browser` and it will launch the react app.

#### Step by step

- `npm install --global expo-cli`
- `npm install`
- `expo start`
- on the `expo` portal click on `run in web browser`
